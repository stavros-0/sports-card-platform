                        I am the creator of @story.sale.reposter on Instagram, and have posted stories on the page for free for a few years, and I wanted to build a sports card community online.

                        This way people could get views on their story sales without having to tag @story.sale.reposter and having to wait for me to manually upload each story sale.

                        Instagram has made it harder over the years to repost stories. Some people are not able to DM the account, and Instagram doesn't allow me to post a lot of stories in a row.

                        With this website, I hope to create a community that can openly market their cards without having to pay the fees.
